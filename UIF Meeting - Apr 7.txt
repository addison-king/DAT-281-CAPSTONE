Apr 7, 2021 Meeting
	BG & Kirsten

Question for Eric:
	The more I think about how to simplify and cover all cases, the more I get bogged down and struggle to get out.

Pre-Meeting Notes
	Input
		K.I.S.S.
		How do we make inputting as simple as possible?
		
		What does their current input process consist of?
		
		Eric:
			write a nice script to interact with google to a known place
			link a google form to the alumni #, firstname, lastname
		
	Output
		Focus on WHAT they want
		Focus on WHAT they currently use
			This leads us to figuring out HOW to deliver
			
		How to visualize alumni in the db?
			What do they want to be able to see? 
			How would they like the output to be?

		Customize queries?
			Eric: don't tackle the custom queries 
				focus on reports and what they use right now
					build a few reports that answers questions they have
					questions about their goal
						e.g. which alumni do we reach out first with our available time?
					organizations that they are trying to optimize
						I can then write scripts to answer these questions
